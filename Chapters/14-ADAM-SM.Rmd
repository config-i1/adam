<!-- # Scale model for ADAM -->
<!-- So far, we have focused our discussion on the location of a model (e.g. conditional mean, point forecasts), neglecting the fact that in some situations the variance of a model might exhibit some time-varying patterns. In statistics, this is called "heteroscedasticity" and implies that the variance of the residuals of a model is not constant. In some cases we might get away with multiplicative model, which takes care of heteroscedasticity caused by changing level of data if the variance is proportional to its value. But there might be situations, where variance changes due to some external factors, not necessarily available to the analyst. In this situation, it should be captured separately using a different model. -->

<!-- In this chapter, we discuss existing models for time varying variance, such as ARCH and GARCH, then move to the discussion of their implementation in ADAM framework and their relation to ADAM Scale Model. We finish by discussing how such model can be estimated in real life. This chapter is inspired by GAMLSS model, which models the scale of distribution using functions of explanatory variables. We build upon that introducing the dynamic element in the model. -->


<!-- ## ARCH and GARCH models -->
<!-- The formulation, basic principles -->


<!-- ## ADAM SM -->
<!-- Connection with the conventional one, ETS, ARIMA and Regression with Scale Model -->

<!-- We extend the general ADAM framework, introduced in Section \@ref(ADAMIntermittentFull) with the introduction of the non-constant variance in the following way: -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!--   \begin{aligned} -->
<!--     & y_t = o_t z_t \\ -->
<!--     & z_{t} = w(\mathbf{v}_{t-\mathbf{l}}) + r(\mathbf{v}_{t-\mathbf{l}}) \epsilon_t \\ -->
<!--     & \epsilon_t = \varsigma({\mathbf{v}_{\epsilon,t-\mathbf{l}}}) \upsilon_t \\ -->
<!--     & \mathbf{v}_{t} = f(\mathbf{v}_{t-\mathbf{l}}) + g(\mathbf{v}_{t-\mathbf{l}}) \epsilon_t -->
<!--   \end{aligned}, -->
<!--   (\#eq:ETSADAMStateSpaceScale) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- where the error term function $\varsigma({\mathbf{v}_{\xi,t-\mathbf{l}}})$ depends on its own states and set of explanatory variables. -->


<!-- ## Estimation of ADAM SM -->
<!-- How the residuals are extracted, how the stuff is initialised, estimated and then forecasts are produced -->


<!-- ## Example in R -->


<!-- ## ADAM SM order selection -- add this to Chapter 16 -->
