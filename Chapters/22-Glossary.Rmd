# Glossary {-}
In this chapter, I decided to collect all the important definitions that are used in this monograph. I provide not only the specific definitions, but also the references to the sections where they appear.

- **Forecast** is a scientifically justified assertion about possible states of an object in the future (Section \@ref(forecastingPlanningAnalytics)).
- **Forecasting** is a process of producing forecasts (Section \@ref(forecastingPlanningAnalytics)).
- **Analytics** is a systematic process of data analysis to support informed decisions (Section \@ref(forecastingPlanningAnalytics)).
- **Method** is a particular way of doing something (Section \@ref(modelsMethods), @CambridgeMethod).
- **Statistical model** is a mathematical representation of a real phenomenon with a complete specification of distribution and parameters (Section \@ref(modelsMethods), @Svetunkov2019a).
- **True model** is the idealistic statistical model that is correctly specified (has all the necessary components in the correct form), and applied to the data in population" (Section \@ref(modelsMethods), @SvetunkovSBA).
- **Applied** or **estimated model** is the statistical model that is applied to the available sample of data (Section \@ref(modelsMethods)).
- **Data Generating Process** is the mathematical model according to which the data was generated (Section \@ref(modelsMethods)). Only makes sense in case of simulated data.
- **Forecast horizon** is the number of observations for which the forecasting is done (Section \@ref(typesOfForecasts)).
- **Error measure** or **error metric** is an indicator that captures performance of an approach in terms of some specific statistics (e.g. mean, median etc. Section \@ref(errorMeasures)).
- **Coverage** is the metric that shows the percentage of observations lying inside the interval (Section \@ref(uncertainty)).
- **Range** is the metric that shows the width of the prediction interval (Section \@ref(uncertainty)).
- **Rolling origin** evaluation is the scheme when the forecasts performance is assessed iteratively on a moving holdout sample by adding observations to the in-sample. This is sometimes also called "Time series cross-validation" (Section \@ref(rollingOrigin)).
- **Fixed origin** evaluation is the scheme when the forecasts performance is assessed only once for a specific test set based on the model estimated on a specific training set (Section \@ref(rollingOrigin)).
- **Level** is the expected (average) value for a specific time period (Section \@ref(tsComponents)).
- **Growth** or a **trend** is the average increase or decrease of the value over a period of time (Section \@ref(tsComponents)).
- **Seasonality** is a pattern that repeats itself with a fixed periodicity (Section \@ref(tsComponents)).
- **Error** is an unexplainable part of data (white noise) that happens due to exhistence of many small factors impacting the response variable (Section \@ref(tsComponents)).
- **Response** or **output** variable is the variable of interest that we want to forecast (Chapter \@ref(ADAMX)).
- **Explanatory**, or **exogenous**, or **input variable** is the variable that impacts the response variable but is not impacted by it (Chapter \@ref(ADAMX)).
- **Deterministic component** is the component that does not evolve over time. e.g. a deterministic trend is the constant trend that does not change its slope in the data (Section \@ref(tsComponents)).
- **Stochastic component** is the component that can change its value over time. e.g. a stochastic trend can be positive in the beginning of the sample than slowly change its value and become negative by the end of the sample (Section \@ref(tsComponents)).
- **Additive component** is the component that is added to the level of the data. e.g. additive seasonality implies that there is an increase in sales every January by $x$ units in comparison with the baseline level (Section \@ref(tsComponents)).
- **Multiplicative component** is the component that is multiplied by the level of the data. e.g. multiplicative seasonality implies that there is an increase in sales every January by $x$% in comparison with the baseline level (Section \@ref(tsComponents)).
