# Multiple frequencies in ADAM ETS

@Taylor2003 proposed an exponential smoothing model with double seasonality and applied it to energy data. Since then, the topic was developed by @Gould2008, @Taylor2008, @Taylor2010, @DeLivera2010 and @DeLivera2011. In this chapter we will discuss some of the proposed models, how they relate to the ADAM framework and can be implemented. Roughly, the idea of a model with multiple seasonalities is in introducing additional seasonal components. For the general framework this means that the state vector (for example, in a model with trend and seasonality) becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{v}_t' =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    l_t & b_t & s_{1,t} & s_{2,t} & \dots & s_{n,t}
    \end{pmatrix},
  (\#eq:ETSADAMSeasonalMultiStateVector)
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of seasonal components (e.g. hour of day, hour of week and hour of year components). The lag matrix in this case becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{l}'=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & m_1 & m_2 & \dots & m_n \end{pmatrix},
    (\#eq:ETSADAMSeasonalMultiStateVectorLags)
\end{equation}
where $m_i$ is the $i$-th seasonal periodicity. While, in theory there can be combinations between additive and multiplicative seasonal components, we argue that such a mixture does not make sense, and the components should align with each other. This means that in case of ETS(M,N,M), all seasonal components should be multiplicative, while in ETS(A,A,A) they should be additive. This results fundamentally in two types of models:

1. Additive seasonality:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    & {y}_{t} = \check{y}_t + s_{1,t-m_1} + \dots + s_{n,t-m_n} \epsilon_t \\
    & \vdots \\
    & s_{1,t} = s_{1,t-m_1} + \gamma_1 \epsilon_t \\
    & \vdots \\
    & s_{n,t} = s_{n,t-m_n} + \gamma_n \epsilon_t
  \end{aligned},
  (\#eq:ETSADAMAdditiveSeasonality)
\end{equation}
where $\check{y}_t$ is the point value based on all non-seasonal components (e.g. $\check{y}_t=l_{t-1}$ in case of no trend model) and $\gamma_i$ is the $i$-th seasonal smoothing parameter.

2. Multiplicative seasonality:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    & {y}_{t} = \check{y}_t \times s_{1,t-m_1} \times \dots \times s_{n,t-m_n} \times(1+\epsilon_t) \\
    & \vdots \\
    & s_{1,t} = s_{1,t-m_1} (1 + \gamma_1 \epsilon_t) \\
    & \vdots \\
    & s_{n,t} = s_{n,t-m_n} (1+ \gamma_n \epsilon_t)
  \end{aligned}.
  (\#eq:ETSADAMMultiplicativeSeasonality)
\end{equation}

Depending on a specific model, the number of seasonal components can be 1, 2, 3 or more (although more than 3 might not make much sense from modelling point of view). @DeLivera2010 introduced components based on fourier terms, updated over time via smoothing parameters. This feature is not yet fully supported in `adam()`, but it is possible to substitute some of seasonal components (especially those that have fractional periodicity) with fourier terms via explanatory variables and update them over time. The explanatory variables idea was discussed in the [previous chapter](#ETSX).


## Using explanatory variables for multiple seasonalities {#ETSXMultipleSeasonality}
The conventional way of introducing several seasonal components has several issues:

1. It only works with the data with fixed periodicity (the problem sometimes referred to as "fractional frequency"): if $m_i$ is not fixed and changes from period to period, the model becomes disaligned. An example of such problem is fitting ETS on daily data with $m=365$, while there are leap years that contain 366 days;
2. If the model is fit on high frequency data, the problem of parameters estimation becomes non-trivial. Indeed, on daily data with $m=365$, we need to estimate 364 initial seasonal indices together with the other parameters;
3. Different seasonal indices would "compete" with each other for each observation, thus making the model overfit the data. An example is the daily data with $m_1=7$ and $m_2=365$, where both seasonal components are updated on each observation based on the same error, but with different smoothing parameters.

The situation becomes even more complicated, when the model has more than two seasonal components. But there are at least two ways of resolving these issues in ADAM framework.

The first is based on the idea of @DeLivera2010 and the [dynamic ETSX](#ETSXDynamic). In this case we need to generate fourier series and use them as explanatory variables in the model, switching on the mechanism of adaptation. For example, for the pure additive model, in this case, we will have:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    & {y}_{t} = \check{y}_t + \sum_{i=1}^p a_{i,t-1} x_{i,t} + \epsilon_t \\
    & \vdots \\
    & a_{i,t} = a_{i,t-1} + \delta_i \frac{\epsilon_t}{x_{i,t}} \text{ for each } i \in \{1, \dots, p\}
  \end{aligned},
  (\#eq:ETSXADAMMultipleSeasonalityFourier)
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the number of fourier harmonics. In this case, we can introduce the conventional seasonal part of the model for the fixed periodicity (e.g. days of week) in $\check{y}_t$ and use the updated harmonics for the non-fixed one. This approach is not the same as the one in @DeLivera2010, but might lead to similar results. The only issue here is in the selection of the number of harmonics, which can be done via the [variables selection mechanism](#ETSXSelection).

The second option is based on the idea of [dynamic model with categorical variables](#ETSXDynamicCategories). In this case, instead of trying to fix the problem with days of year, we first introduce the categorical variables for days of week and then for the weeks of year (or months of year if we can assume that the effects of months are more appropriate). After that we can introduce both categorical variables in the model, using the similar adaptation mechanism to \@ref(eq:ETSXADAMMultipleSeasonalityFourier). In fact, if some of variables have fixed periodicity, we can substitute them with the conventional seasonal components. So, for example, in this case, ETSX(M,N,M)[7]{D} could be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    & {y}_{t} = l_{t-1} s_{t-7} \times \prod_{i=1}^q \exp(a_{i,t-1} x_{i,t}) (1 + \epsilon_t) \\
    & l_t = l_{t-1} (1 + \alpha\epsilon_t) \\
    & s_t = s_{t-7} (1 + \gamma\epsilon_t) \\
    & a_{i,t} = a_{i,t-1} + \left \lbrace \begin{aligned}
                  &\delta \log(1+\epsilon_t) \text{ for each } i \in \{1, \dots, q\}, \text{ if } x_{i,t} = 1 \\
                  &0 \text{ otherwise }
            \end{aligned} \right.
  \end{aligned},
  (\#eq:ETSXADAMMultipleSeasonalityCategories)
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the number of levels in the categorical variable (for weeks of year, this should be 53). The number of parameters to estimate in this case might be greater than the number of harmonics in the first case, but this type of model resolves all three issues as well and does not have the dilema about selecting the number of harmonics.


## Dealing with daylight saving and leap years
Another problem that arises in case of data with high frequency is the change of local time due to daylight saving (DST). This happens in some countries two times a year: in Spring the time is moved one hour forward (typically at 1am to 2am), while in the Autumn it is moved back one hour. The implications of this are terrifying from forecasting point of view, because one day of year has 23 hours, while the other one has 25 hours, while all the business processes are aligned to the local time. This means that if the conventional seasonal ETS model with $m=24$ is fit to the data, it will only work correctly in a half of year. Well, it will adapt to the new patterns after some times, but this implies that the smoothing parameter $\gamma$ will be higher than needed.

There are two solutions to this problem:
1. Shift the periodicity for one day, when the time changes from 24 to either 23, or 25, depending on the time of year;
2. Introduce categorical variables for factors, which will mark specific hours of day;

The former is more difficult to formalise mathematically and implement in software, but the latter relies on the already discussed mechanism of [ETSX{D} with categorical variables](#ETSXDynamicCategories) and should be more straightforward. Given the connection between seasonality in the conventional ETS model and the ETSX{D} with categorical variables for seasonality, both approaches should be equivalent in terms of parameters estimation and final forecasts.

Similarly, the problem with leap years can be solved either using the shift from $m=365$ to $m=366$ on 29th February in a spirit of the option (1), or using the categorical variables, approach (2). There is a difference, however: the former would be suitable for the data with only one leap year, where the estimation of the seasonal index for 29th February might be difficult, while the latter assumes the separate estimation of the parameter (so it has one more parameter to estimate). However, given the discussion in [the previous section](ETSXMultipleSeasonality), maybe we should not bother with $m=365$ in the first place and rethink the problem, if possible. Having 52 / 53 weeks in a year has similar difficulties, but at least does not involve the estimation of so many initial seasonal states.


## Estimation of multiple seasonal models

Why it is a difficult task, how to speed it up:

1. Different initials,
2. Deterministic components,

Also use multistep functions to get better forecasts.
